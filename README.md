This repository holds my blog which you can see at
[martinbrochhaus.com](http://martinbrochhaus.com).

It is generated by [Pelican](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican) and hosted
on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

If you find any errors or amendments to my articles, I would be more than glad
to merge your pull request. Please just submit patches to the .md files, don't
worry about generating the .html output with Pelican.

# TODO

* Figure out how to push output to the gh-pages branch
* Update fabfile to reflect new workflow
* Update blog post about how this is setup
