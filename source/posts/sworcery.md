Title: Swords & Sworery EP Review
Slug: sworcery

Tags: gaming, reviews
status: draft

* Screenshots and gameplay videos got me interested immediately
* Weird language draws me into the unique fantasy world immediately
* Music is wonderful, just what I expected
* First fight ends in frustration, because I don't know how to draw my sword
  on the MacBook's trackpad and the in-game instruction seems to resemble a
  magic mouse, which I did not understand since I never used one. So it was
  just a doubleclick, which I discovered by chance when hammering randomly onto
  the keyboard
* When the first boss chases me, I actually feel excited. I allow him to kill
  me and I am glad to find out that I will be re-spawned just at the beginning
  of that scene. That's the kind of gameplay that I like.
* After maybe an hour of playing I have solved 23%... really? I would be a
  shame if the game would be that short.
