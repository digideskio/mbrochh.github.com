* Screenshots and gameplay videos got me interested immediately
* Weird language draws me into the unique fantasy world immediately
* Music is wonderful, just what I expected
* First fight ends in frustration, because I don't know how to draw my sword
  on the MacBook's trackpad and the in-game instruction seems to resemble a
  magic mouse, which I did not understand since I never used one. So it was
  just a doubleclick, which I discovered by chance when hammering randomly onto
  the keyboard
* When the first boss chases me, I actually feel excited. I allow him to kill
  me and I am glad to find out that I will be re-spawned just at the beginning
  of that scene. That's the kind of gameplay that I like.
* After maybe an hour of playing I have solved 23%... really? I would be a
  shame if the game would be that short.
* Went into the dreamland of the Woodfella. Quite funny and so many mushrooms.
  I wondered what they are good for, but could not discover anything. The dream
  ends super simple, just follow the singing bear. Weird.
* Later I discovered that the mushrooms help to find stuff in the woods. I
  wonder if they spawn all the time of I have to be smart when to use them and
  when not. They seem to be limited, what a shame.
* Rubbing the rainbows. What a cool idea.
* After my third session I'm 36% into the game.
* After my 4th session I'm 42% into the game and won the first boss fight. It
  is really cool how your moves are in sync with the music which indeed is
  super awesome and gets me into a mood of excitement while doing the rather
  simple fight. However it was just hard enough to take me 2 tries to
  understand the pattern and two more tries to finish the stage. At every
  failure the book gives more hints on how to solve the boss, which is nice as
  a game should entertain and not frustrate.
* I also like how the game closes the curtain after each chapter and asks for a
  break. I think for a short game like this it gives you the chance to think
  about what you have seend and heard (and it indeed is the stuff that gets you
  thinking, very artistic and poetic and great music). And after a while the
  desire to play more will arise which will give you an overall good memory
  about the game later ("I constantly felt like I wanted to return to the
  game"). If I just finished this in one session I would probably complain that
  it only took me 3 hours to beat the game.
* After my 5th session I am 53% into the game. Instead of moving through the 
  gate as the game suggested I went to the hut and took a nap. Luckily it was
  a full moon so the dreamland had more souls to discover and led me to a whole
  new realm. As usual, music and visuals are wonderful. I love the game and I
  hated to stop the dream world and go to sleep. What if it kicks me out since
  full moon will be over tomorrow?
